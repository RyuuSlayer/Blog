Alright, today is a great day. Remember my first blog article in which i showcased RomVault, a tool to manage your ROM collection?

Do you hate it as much as i do, that all the digital games you bought years ago for your Wii, DSi, 3DS or Wii U will be lost to time simply because of server shutdowns?
This is with no doubt the sad truth, which has in the past lead to ROMs going MIA (Missing in Action), because eShop titles simply might get taken down. We know they exsisted, we have their hash because someone once contributed it to the datting organization. But nobody seems to have gotten hold of these files over the years.

In this image you can exactly see what has been added, sets with MIAs are recognized as completed even with MIAs. But the incredible part about this, if someone ever scans one of these MIAs with RomVault, it will be sent to a database and be marked as found. (This can be turned off if you value privacy, though i would appreciate you keeping it on.) This feature makes RomVault the leading MIA listing.

As a nice quality of life improvement, we got blessed with custom icons which can easily be replaced with whatever icon you can dream of. Either drop this [**zip**](/assets/09-06-22/graphics-accessible.zip) (Made by johnsanc from the RV discord.) into the same folder as the RomVault.exe and rename it to **graphics** or for ease of editing put the content of the zip into a folder with the same name. Yes i am working on a pepe pack.

I highly suggest you checking out RomVaults [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/fVJQPA8), people on there have been very helpful to me, and i am sure they can be to you.
Watch out for my coming article on how to convert most ROMs properly, to result in matching de/encrypted ROMs for all kinds of consoles, suited for your RomVault library!
